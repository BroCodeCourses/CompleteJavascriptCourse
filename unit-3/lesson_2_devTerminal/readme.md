# Welcome to unit-3 Lesson 2: The Developer Terminal

While your chrome browser is open, hold (Command + Option + i) to open the terminal and get the lesson started.

## Elements
The elements tab can be found on the far left of the navigation bar, and upon clicking it you will open the Document Object Model for your current webpage. This is where you'll find all of the html and accompanying css that make up the webpage. 
Have some with this! If you click the arrow in the upper left corner of the terminal, you'll be able to select any element on the screen. Go ahead and find some text and see if you can find it and then alter it in the DOM!

## Console
The second tab, console, is where you can type javascript code that will interact with the webpage. We'll get more into this in the next lesson, but as a developer you'll come to use this console regularly, not only as a means of development but as a
means of debugging and perfecting your code as well!

## Sources
The sources tab shows you the files that are contributing to the webpage's structure. If you open this tab on any popular website you'll likely see a wide array of file types that don't make a ton of sense, and that's okay! A lot goes into making 
a website, especailly one used by millions of users a day. But if you were to go back to our html file in the previous lesson and open the terminal (which you should), you'll see the simple file structure you pulled down with github.

## Network, Performace, Memory
The other tabs have their uses but they're beyond the scope of this lesson. For the rest of this unit we'll be focused primarily on the Elements and Console tab.
(The DOM and how to manipulate it).
